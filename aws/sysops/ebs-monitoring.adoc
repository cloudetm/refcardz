=== *Monitoring EBS*

.*VolumeReadBytes&VolumeWriteBytes*
----
 The sum staticist reports the total number of bytes transfered
 Average is also useful to see the average size of each I/O operation
----

.*VolumeReadOps&VolumeWriteOps*
----
 Represents the total number of I/O operations
 You can calculate the averate I/O operations per second IOPS for
  a period by dividing the total operations by the number of seconds
  in that period
----

.*VolumeTotalReadTime&VolumeTotalWriteTime*
----
 The total number of seconds spent by all operations in a given
  time period
 A steady increase in these numbers could indicate the need to
  increase volume size of increase the nuber of provisioned IOPS
----

.*VolumeQueueLength*
----
 Number of read/write operation requests waiting to finish
----

.*VolumeThroughputPercentage*
----
 The percentage of I/O operations per second that we achieved
  out of the total provisioned IOPS for our EBS volume
----

.*VolumeConsumedReadWriteOps*
----
 The total amount of read and write operations consumed within a
  specific time period
----
