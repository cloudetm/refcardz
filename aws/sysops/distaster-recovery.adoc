== *Distaster Recovery*

.*DR - Disaster Recovery*
----
Is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster. Any event that has a negative
impact on a company's business continuity or finances could be termed a disaster.
This includes hardware or software failure, a network outage, a power outage,
physical damage to a building like fire or flooding, human error, or some other
significant event.
----

.*RTO - Recovery Time Objective*
----
Is the length of time from which you can recover a disaster. It is measured from when the
disaster first occured as to when you have fully recovered from it.
----

.*RPO - Recovery Point Objective*
----
Is the amount of data you organisation is prepared to lose in the event of a disaster
(1 day worth of emails, 5 hours of online transaction records etc, 24 hours of backup etc).
----

.*Why AWS for DR*
----
Only minimum hardware is reguired for "data replication"
Allows you to be flexible depending on what your disaster is and how to recover from it
Opex cost model(pay as you use) rather than heavy investment upfront. Scaling is quick
and easy
Automate disaster recovery deployment

Backup&Restore <- Pilot Light <- Warm Standby <- Multi Site
----

.*Backup and Restore*
----
In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and send off-site
regularry. If you use this method, it can take a long time to restore your
system in the event of a disruption or disaster. Amazon S3 is an ideal
destination for backup data that might be needed quickly to perform a restore.
Transfering data to and from Amazon S3 typiccaly done through network, and is
therefore accessible from any location.
You can use AWS Import/Export to transfer very large data sets by shipping
storage devices directly to AWS.

Key Steps for backup & restore:
1. Select an appropriate tool or method to back up you data into AWS
2. Ensure that you have an appropriate retention policy for this data
3. Ensure that appropriate security measures are in place for this data,
including encryption and access policies
4. Regularly test the recovery of this data and the restoration of you system


1. Freeze data changes to the DR site
2. Take a backup
3. Restore the backup to the primary site
4. Re-Point users to the primary site
5. Unfreeze the changes

. *Pilot Light*
----
The term Pilot Ligth is often used to describe a DR scenario in whicn a minimal version
of an environment is always running in the cloud. The idea of the pilot light is an
analogy that comes from the gas heater. In a gas heater, a small flame that's always
on can quicly ignite the entire furnance to heat up a house.

Infrastructure elements for the pilot light itself typically include your database servers,
which would replicate data to Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS. Depending on the system, there might
be other critical data outside of the database that needs to be replicated to AWS.

To provision the remainder of the infrastructure to resotre business critical services, you
would typically have some preconfigured servers bundled as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which
are ready to be started up at a moment's notice.

Provision for Pilot Light
1. User pre-allocated elastic IP addresses and associate them with your instances when invoking DR
You can also use pre-allocated elastic network interfaces (ENIs) with pre-allocated MAC Addresses
for applications with special licensing requirements
2. Use Elastic Load Balancing to distrubute traffic to multiple instances. You would then update
you DNS records to point at your Amazon EC2 instance or point to your load balancer using a CNAM

1. Establish reverse mirroing/replicatoin from the DR site back to the primary site,
once the primary site has caught up with the changes
2. Freeze data changes to the DR site
3. Re-Point users to the primary site
4. Unfreeze the changes
----

.*Warm Standby*
----
The term standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of fully
functional environment is always running in the cloud. A warm standby solution extends
the pilot light elements and preparation. It futher decreases the recovery time because
some services are always running. By identifying you business-critical systems, you can
fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on.

Key Steps for Preparation:
1. Set up Amazon EC2 instances to replicate or mirror data
2. Create and maintain AMIs
3. Run you application using a minimal footprint of Amazon EC2 instances or AWS
infrastructure
4. Patch and update software and configuration files in line with you live
environment

Key Steps for Recovery:
1. Increase the size of the Amazon EC2 fleets in service with the load balancer(horizontal scaling)
2. Start applications on larger Amazon EC2 instance types as needed (vertical scaling)
3. Either manually changes the DNS records, or use Amazon Route 53 automated health checks so that
all traffic is routed to the AWS environment.
4. Consider using Auto Scaling to right-size the fleet or accomodate the increased load
5. Add resilience or scale up you database
----

.*Multi Site*
----
Key Steps for milty site preparation:
1. Set up you AWS environment to duplicate you production environment
2. Set up DNS weigting, or similar traffic routing technology, to distribute incoming
requests to both sites. Configure automated failover to re-route traffic away from the affected
site

3. Either manually or by using DNS failover, change the DNS weighting so that all requests are sent
to the AWS site
4. Have application logic failover to use the local AWS database servers for all queries
5. Consider using Auto Scaling to automatically right-size the AWS fleet

Typically the lower RTO&RPO threshold, the more costly it solution will be.
