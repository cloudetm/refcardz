== *Elastic Load Balancer & Cloud Watch Metrics*

.*HealthyHostCount*
----
The count of the number of healthy instances in each Availability Zone. A newly created instance considered healty
after it passes the first health check. If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, the count of the number of healty instances
is calculated for all Availabilty Zones.
----

.*UnhealthyHostCount*
----
The number of unhealty isntances registered with you load balancer. An instance is considered unhealthy after
it exceeds the unhealthy threshold configured for health checks. An unhealthy instance is considered healthy
again after it meets the healthy threshold configured for health checks.
----

.*RequestCount*
----
The count of the number of completed requests that were received and routed to the back-end instances.
----

.*Latency*
----
Measures the time elapsed in seconds after the request leaves the load balancer until the response is received.
----

.*HTTPCode_ELB_4XX*
----
The count of number of HTTP 4XX client error generated by the load balancer when the listener is configured to use
HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Client errors are generated when a request is milformed or is incomplete.
----

.*HTTPCode_ELB_5XX*
----
The count of the number of HTTP 5XX server error codes generated by the load balancer when the listener
 is configured to use HTTP or HTTPS protocols. The metric is reported if there are no back-end instances
 that are healthy or registered to the load balancer, of if the request rate exceeds the capacity of
 the instances of the load balancer.
----

.*BackEndConnectionErrors*
----
The count of the number of connections that were not successfuly established between the load balancer
and the registered instances. Because the load balancer will retry when there are connection errors,
this count can exceed the request rate.
----

.*SurgeQueueLength*
----
A count of the total number of requests that are pending submissions to a registered instance.
----

.*SpilloverCount*
----
A count of the total number of requests that were rejected due to the queue being full.
