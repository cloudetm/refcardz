== *Scalability & Elasticity*

.*Scale Out*
----
 Traditionally - adding more resources
 EC2 - adding additional instances and using autoscaling
----

.*Scale UP*
----
  Increase the number of processors, the number of RAM or the
   amount of storage.
  Increases instance type from T1 to T2 for example
----

.*Scalability*
----
 We Can increase the size of instances
 There are different instance types we can choose from to grow
 We cal launch more instances

 DynamoDB example:
  We can keep storing more and more data without having to
   provision any hardware

 RDS:
   We can increase the size of instances
   Launch read replicas
   There are different instance types we can choose from to grow
----

.*Elasticity*
----
 Auto Scaling gives the ability to grow with demand, and shrink
  during slower periods

  DynamoDB example:
   We can increase or decrease read and write throughput capacity
    on demand
   As read requestsincrease, we can increase read trhroughput capacity
   As read requests slow down, we can decrease capacity

  RDS:
   Limited
----

.*Autoscaling*
----
  Distribute the load across multiple instances
  Uses metrics and rules to automate spinning/terminating instances
----

.*Resizing*
----
 Increase/decrease resources available to out application
