Description: >
    This template contains the security groups required by our entire stack.
    We create them in a seperate template, so they can be referenced
    by all of the other templates.

Parameters:
    NetworkStackName:
        Description: Base stack name that contains stack resources
        Type: String

    EnvironmentName:
        Description: An environment name that will be prefixed to resource names
        Type: String

    NottinghamCIDRIp:
        Type: "String"
        Default: "81.108.34.254/32"

Resources:
    # This security group defines who/where is allowed to access the ECS hosts directly.
    # By default we're just allowing access from the load balancer.  If you want to SSH
    # into the hosts, or expose non-load balanced services you can open their ports here.
