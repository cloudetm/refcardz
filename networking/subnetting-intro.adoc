# Introduction to sugnetting

## Introduction
   A Brief introduction to binary and some basic subnetting.

   People are always advertising fancy tricks, tips, magic, etc to make subnetting easier. The fact is,
  subnetting is only as difficult as you make it. The best way to learn subnetting is just to do it!
  Before long, it will become second nature.

## Binary
  Let's start with binary. As you know, the entire internet communicationes with electrical signals sent
 through copper, fiber, or even through the air. These signals are nothing more than a series of waves,
 pulses, or lights thta indicate either or on or off. For instance, if the medium is fiber optics,
 these are essentially blinking lights. They are blinking MUCH faster that we can perceive, but they are blinking.
 Each time the light is on, it signifies a 1 and when the light is off, it signifies a 0. Each 1 or 0 is called a bit.
 These bits stream  together to form binary code. Binary stands for 2, which represents the 2 possible digits, 0 and 1.
 These signals are grouped together in predetermined lengths to indicate when the message stops and starts.

 An IP address is 4 Bytes or 4 blocks of 8 bits. Keep in mind that when abbreviating bits and Bytes, a Capital B
 signifies Bytes and a lowercase b signifies bits. I will capitalize Bytes throughout this guide to remind you of that
 fact. As an example, consider the binary representation of the IP address 192.168.0.1
 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001

 Each Byte in an IP address is also called an octet. The oct in octet refers to 8.
